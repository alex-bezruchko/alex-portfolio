                    <p>A little over five years ago, I wrote my first line of code and was
                        hooked into the challenging but cool world of programming. At the time, I was a health insurance
                        agent which while was financially rewarding career was not the most exciting of challenges. I worked
                        through some courses on Codecademy, Team TreeHouse, Udemy among other and began to imagine coding as
                        much fun as well as a rewarding experience.

                    <p class="px-8">After picking up the basics, I've learned CMS php frameworks such as Drupal and
                        WordPress as well as NodeJS (backend), ReactJS and VueJs (frontend) for my projects with great
                        results. The learning has continued and coding has turned from a hobby into a passion that I want to
                        pursue each and every day. Iâ€™m a self-taught developer with a passion for code and what it can add
                        to our work, our communities, and our world.
