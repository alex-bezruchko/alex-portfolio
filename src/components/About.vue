                        About five years ago, I wrote my first line of code and was hooked. At the time I was a health
                        insurance agent, which while a financially rewarding career, was not my passion. I decided to
                        continue exploring programming. I worked through some courses (Codecademy, TreeHouse and Udemy,
                        etc), and began to imagine coding as a career; the more I learned, the more I realized that it was
                        not only intellectually rewarding, but I loved it!

                        After picking up the basics, I tried CMS php frameworks, such as Drupal and WordPress, but quickly
                        moved on to Laravel, NodeJS (backend) and ReactJS and VueJs (frontend) for my projects; all with
                        great results. Iâ€™m a self-taught developer, and my learning has continued, and coding has turned
                        from a hobby into a passion.
